  Version 0.2.0
* Shim pkgconf.exe if conf-pkg-config is installed (allows dune-configurator to
  access it from outside of a package installation).
* Create shim executables for any non-PATH installation of Cygwin. In
  particular, this allows ocaml/setup-ocaml@v3 to function correctly (it uses
  `--cygwin-location` so that Cygwin is stored separately from the opam root).
